## Inspiration

People who have diabetes may develop diabetic retinopathy (DR) which can impair everyday living quality and victims' chances of survival by causing vision loss and blindness. The current inadequate management of ocular diseases is made worse by the inconsistency between clinicians, which is essential for a prompt and accurate diagnosis

## What it does ?
The first signs of fatigue or disease were shown by our eyes. Thus came the design of A.Iris- a web app to accurately detect eye diseases and provide results quickly. A.Iris solves the problem of detecting eye diseases by using advanced machine learning models and a user-friendly interface.
